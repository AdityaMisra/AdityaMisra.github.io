Builder. Lifelong Learner. Building technology that scales and makes an impact. I build scalable backend systems and platforms that teams can trust. Passionate about clean design, developer experience, and continuous learning, I share insights through mentoring, consulting, and writing. About Engineer by profession, mountain person by soul, Londoner by postcode. I enjoy building systems that scale, learning something new daily, and convincing people dark mode is objectively superior. Dogs are great, winters are better, and pair programming proves that suffering through bugs is more fun together. Swimming is my cardio of choice, running and I have agreed to stay acquaintances. What I\u0026#39;m Working On I share updates and ideas on building scalable systems, developer experience, and career growth.
