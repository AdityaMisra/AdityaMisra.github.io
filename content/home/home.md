{{< text-section sectionId="interests" title="Interests" >}}
Apart from being an engineer, I love travelling. I am an avid reader and also explore podcasts and audiobooks to gain insights on different perspectives of the world. Currently, I'm reading about human behaviour & societies, and how they have evolved overtime.

I am also a fan of sci-fi and comedy genre movies and television shows. A large amount of my free time goes into learning technology advancements in the web development world to satiate my curiosity.
